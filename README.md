# Solar System Demo

Welcome to Solar System Explorer project!

This aim of this project is to demonstrate the capabilities of AI coding assistance. Everything you see here was built by instructing an LLM.

I used Windsurf IDE for coding along with Claude 3.7 to complete the project.

It took around 10 hours from start to finish. The result? An immersive 3D experience right in your browser.

## Features
1. Scientific mode with accurate planetary orbits
2. Sci-Fi mode with wormholes and spacecraft travel
3. Adjustable simulation speed
4. Realistic planet textures and atmospheres
5. Mars mission simulation with Hohmann transfer orbit
6. Interesting space event in sci-fi mode
7. Easter egg for AC/DC fans

## Technologies Used

*   [React](https://reactjs.org/)
*   [Three.js](https://threejs.org/)
*   [@react-three/fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber)
*   [@react-three/drei](https://github.com/pmndrs/drei)
*   [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
*   [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd solar-system-demo
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will start the Vite development server, usually at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

*   `npm run dev` or `npm start`: Runs the app in development mode.
*   `npm run build`: Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.
*   `npm run preview`: Serves the production build locally.
*   `npm run lint`: Lints the project files using ESLint.
